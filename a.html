    <h1>HOW A LONG HAUL FLIGHT INSPIRED AN ULTRASLIM REVOLUTION
    </h1>
    <h6>Gaming power used to only come in two form factors: big and bigger. The first gaming laptops prioritized power over everything else, adding as many kilograms and centimeters as needed to fit the highest-end components. "Portable" was relative.
    </h6>
    <h6>This inconvenience became all too clear forto one of ROG's marketing leaders during one flight in 2016. Tasked with bringing our top-of-the-line ROG G752 overseas, he had an inspirational experience.
    </h6>
<h6>Namely, he discovered that hand-carrying 4.4kg (nearly 10lbs) of power across long airport terminals, jet bridges, and international waters was not the kind of fun a gaming laptop is supposed to offer.
</h6>
<h6>The second his trip was over, he marched into the Head of PC's office and said, "Dude. We need a lighter gaming laptop!" That simple statement launched the Zephyrus project.
</h6>
<h6>ROG designers iterated on dozens of new concepts to put desktop-sized power into a thinner, lighter, and more travel-friendly chassis.
</h6>
<h6>The radical Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) enabled ROG to pack unprecedented power into ultraslim devices, allowing us to repeatedly break down barriers of portable gaming in the years since.</h6>
